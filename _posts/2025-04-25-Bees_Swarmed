This is the secondary swarm from Hive #2.  This hive was a split from Papa and Mimi's house.  It was originally a new hive that we made from an old queen, one which I have now in a Nuc box.  The first swarm fly to the neighbor's tree.  This secondary swarm went to the exact same place. To say this is frustrating would be an understatement.  It is clearly an issue with the beekeeper and not the bees, who are performing their natural instict of reproduction.  Something needs to change...
